The exact needs of the process are subject to the type of data that needs to be migrated but must include certain aspects such as ensuring data accuracy, data integrity and data security, as well as contemplating the need for integration of both systems, if applicable.\n",

The migration process should include the development of efficient data validation methods to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data upon the completion of the process.
